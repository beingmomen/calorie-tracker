## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (Latest LTS version)
- MongoDB (Latest version)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd express
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `config.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=1234
DATABASE=your_mongodb_connection_string
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN=90

EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
EMAIL_HOST=your_email_host
EMAIL_PORT=your_email_port
```

## Running the Project

Development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Production mode:

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:1234` by default.
